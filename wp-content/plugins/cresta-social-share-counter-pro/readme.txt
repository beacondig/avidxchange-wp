== Update ==
The plugin uses the license key to upgrade. If the license key is activated, you will automatically receive an update notification directly to your WordPress Dashboard.
License key is valid for one year from the date of purchase.
After one year, license key may be renewed at a 10% discount from the purchase price of a new license (two weeks before the expiration of the
license key will receive an email and you can decide whether to renew the license or not).
If you decide to not renew the license key no problem, you can continue to use the plugin forever, but you will not receive updates and support.
